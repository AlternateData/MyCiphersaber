ARC4 and Ciphersaber protocals should be seperated
user secrets (passphrase) is null terminated string
Fucntions only will ever return null if null is being put into them or malloc did return null.
This is not at all optimal. A big todo is error/exception handling
It is the callers job to check that the inputs are valid non null values.
